**Mihai Tabacaru, Marketing & Social Media Manager**

Mihai is a self-taught marketing artist, combining design, UX and marketing, all in one. Obssesed with practicality and empathy, Mihai’s ultimate goal is to make lives better by bringing new technologies and new ideas to the people.

“Every product must be focused around being practical and empathetic. If it only looks good but doesn’t connect to a need, whether it’s emotional or practical, it will fail.”
